    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A a quick and easy dish for Pasta with Anchovies</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 oz. spaghetti</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup Olive Oil</li>
        <li> 8 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li> 2 oz. flat fillet anchovies, rinsed</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup capers, rinsed</li>
        <li> handful fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li> Hot pepper (optional)</li>
        <li> Sea salt, to taste
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinade: Combine pork, soy sauce and cornstarch. Mix well and marinate for at least 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Now that the water is boiling, add sea salt to the water and stir in the spaghetti. Continue to boil as
            per the package instructions. I like my spaghetti al dente, so if the package says to cook for 10
            minutes, I would cook my spaghetti for 8-9 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now that the spaghetti is boiling, in a skillet, add the olive oil and garlic and cook until golden.
            Next, add the anchovies and cook over low heat for 5 minutes. Keep an eye on the garlic to ensure that
            they do not burn. Lastly, add the capers and hot pepper and cook for another 2 minutes over low heat,
            until the anchovies are almost melted away.</li>
        <li>Once the spaghetti is done cooking, scoop the pasta into the garlic and anchovy skillet and mix together
            so that the spaghetti absorbs the spicy and garlic flavored olive oil. Add the spaghetti to a big dish,
            and top it off with some fresh parsley.</li>


    </ol>
